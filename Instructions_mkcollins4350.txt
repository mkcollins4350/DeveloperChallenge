## The Python script "capswdev.py" runs on a Linux distro and uses /bin/env
##    to pick a python3 executable/alias.
##
## capswdev.py expects a stream from STDIN and writes a stream to STDOUT. No
##    other behaviour is expected or programmed for.
##
## Therefore the expected behaviour from the user is:
##    1) File-based redirect to STDIN
##       cat <filename> | ./capswdev.py
##
##    2) Text stream pushed onto STDIN
##       ./capswdev.py < TEXT_STREAM
